** questions v1
- what is m4a file
- is music.raw is just sequence of samples?
- can it be done with more basic tools? with not pulseaudio (as wrapper around ALSA), but directly with ALSA?

- m4a is just container format. Nothing interesting
- yes
- sure you can do it, but does it worth it for now?

** question v2
- how to play multiple notes simualteneously? What's the formula for sample value then? Doesn't looks like that the formula is just average value
- sin wave sound
